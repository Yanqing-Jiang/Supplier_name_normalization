# Supplier Name normalization with Python Jupyter Notebook
## - Include a block of code written by students from Rutgers University, master of supply chain for comparison
## - Actual normalization done by hard-coded logic and Python CleanCo package 
## - Attemped using machine learning clustering to further normalization, but failed under 2 reasons: 
## 1. too many supplier names (will take too long) 2.too many name errors for clustering
