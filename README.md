# Supplier Name normalization with Python Jupyter Notebook
## Include 2 block of code design by students from Rutgers University, master of supply chain for comparison
## actual normalization done by hard coded logic and CleanCo package 
## attemped using machine learning clustering to further normalization, but failed under 2 reasons: 
1. too many supplier names (will take too long) 2.too many name errors because of reason 1.
